# TechBook
As part of this project, We have created the TechBook blogging website. It is intended for those who wish to learn about
technology and impart that knowledge to others. delivering users with growing technology news. It may be a fresh concept with an
explanation of one particular subject for the user. There will be a distinct section dedicated to user problem solutions.
so that members of the TechBook family can now discuss their issues. The issue can be resolved from here. 
To begin, we consider two aspects of the TechBook project: the front end is one, and the back end is another. Following that, we
conduct two back-end sessions. One is the authentication section and the other is the app section (including the database). then
the user's registration form is used, also used here are login and logout.
After that, the user has the option of publishing blog posts and has post delete & update features available.
